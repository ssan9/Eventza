## Introduction
A Web App where users would be able to see upcoming events related to local content, eg., movies, concerts, etc. in their desired location, based on the miles and date range selected by them. 
They would get a detailed information on the selected Event regarding the dates, timings, exact location, etc.

This App has been developed with the help of HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery.

Eventful's API has been used here to meld the data. JSONP has been used to make asynchronous requests for data as it was hosted on another 
domain. 
Some plug-ins are also included for additional features, such as Moment.js to set the date's format, Rateyo Plugin to get the ratings for 
the search results from the user.
